        I’m a passionate and curious developer with a love for all things digital, from web design to coding and animation. I’m currently building my skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and I’m always excited to take on new challenges that push my understanding even further. My journey started with a simple yet satisfying project: a cookie clicker game. That small piece of logic sparked something in me .The joy of problem-solving and creating something interactive from scratch. Since then, I’ve been on a mission to learn, build, and grow as a developer.

        Outside of coding, I’m someone who thrives on both mental and physical challenges. I enjoy going to the gym to stay active and clear my mind, playing chess to sharpen my strategic thinking, and immersing myself in gaming to relax and appreciate digital creativity from a different angle. These hobbies balance my passion for technology with personal growth and fun. 
        </p>

        I’m aiming to become a software developer, and I bring a hardworking, engaged attitude to every project I take on. Whether I’m debugging code, designing UI, or collaborating on a team, I’m always learning and always improving — both in and out of the digital space.
