        I’m a passionate and curious developer with a love for all things digital — from web design to coding and animation. I’m building my skills in React.js, HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and Python, and always excited to tackle new challenges. My journey took off when I built a cookie clicker game as my first React project — a test set by Dedalus to assess my skills. That simple, interactive project sparked my enthusiasm for problem-solving and creating from scratch, and I’ve been learning and building ever since.

        During my internship at Dedalus, I gained hands-on experience working on real-world projects in a collaborative, agile environment. I sharpened my skills in Git, testing, debugging, and writing clean, maintainable code, while learning to balance technical requirements with user needs. Working closely with experienced developers also strengthened my communication, teamwork, and problem-solving abilities.

        Outside of coding, I stay sharp and balanced through the gym, chess, and gaming — hobbies that keep me active, strategic, and inspired. I’m aiming to become a software developer, and I bring energy, focus, and a drive to keep improving to every project I take on.
